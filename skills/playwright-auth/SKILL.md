# Playwright Auth Flows

> Shared auth contract for Playwright E2E tests. Scope is strictly authentication --
> defer all other Playwright patterns to the `webapp-testing` skill.

## Auth Flow Contract

Every Playwright auth flow follows the same core sequence regardless of integration style:

**Inputs:**
- Credentials (email + password)
- Login URL (e.g. `/login`, `/sign-in`)
- Form selectors (email input, password input, submit button)

**Outputs:**
- Authenticated `Page` object (post-redirect)
- Optional: saved storage state file for reuse across tests

**Core steps:**
1. Navigate to login URL
2. Wait for form visibility
3. Fill email and password fields
4. Click submit
5. Wait for post-login redirect (URL no longer contains login path)
6. Optionally save `storageState` for subsequent tests

## Integration Styles: Which One and Why

The two styles solve different problems — picking by "which repo already does this" instead of
by what the suite actually needs is how you end up importing POM boilerplate into a suite that
never asserts on the login page, or bolting a fixture factory onto a suite that needs to test
login itself.

**The signal that decides it: is the login flow itself part of what you're testing, or is it
pure setup to get past?**

- **The login page is a test subject** (OAuth buttons, remember-me, rate limiting, error states
  on bad credentials) → **Page Object Model**. A POM gives you an addressable object to assert
  against (`loginPage.errorMessage`, `loginPage.rateLimitBanner`) — a fixture that just hands you
  an authenticated `Page` has nowhere to hang those assertions.
- **Login is scaffolding for everything downstream** (multi-role app, tests only care about
  post-login behavior) → **Fixture (`test.extend()`)**. A fixture bakes auth into test setup so
  test bodies never see a login call — the whole point is zero boilerplate, which a POM instance
  constructed per-test does not give you.

**Cost of choosing wrong:** POM-for-a-fixture-shaped-problem means every test file that needs
`agentPage` and `platformAdminPage` re-instantiates and re-drives a login page object per role,
multiplying boilerplate exactly where the fixture style eliminates it. Fixture-for-a-POM-shaped-
problem means you lose the addressable object entirely — a test asserting "shows rate-limit
banner after 5 failed attempts" has no natural home once login is hidden behind a fixture that
only returns an already-authenticated page.

`references/integration-styles.md`.

## Single-User vs Multi-Role Auth

**Single-user:** One set of credentials, one authenticated page. Use when the app has
no role differentiation or tests only exercise one role.

```typescript
// Single-user: just export one fixture or one POM instance
const authenticatedPage = await loginAs(page, DEFAULT_USER);
```

**Multi-role:** Multiple credential sets, one authenticated page per role. Define personas in the
canonical typed persona catalog and expose each as a named fixture or POM factory.

```typescript
const PERSONAS = {
  platformAdmin: { role: "platform-admin", storageStatePath: ".auth/platform-admin.json" },
  agent: { role: "agency-agent", storageStatePath: ".auth/agent.json" },
};
// Each becomes a separate fixture: platformAdminPage, agentPage, etc.
```

## Persona Catalog + Setup Project State

Playwright auth state is owned by one typed canonical persona catalog. The catalog drives seed
identity, semantic role, credential env keys or deterministic fallbacks, and the `.auth/<persona>.json`
path consumed by fixtures and config.

```typescript
type Persona = {
  key: "admin" | "agent" | "attendee";
  role: "platform-admin" | "agency-agent" | "event-attendee";
  emailEnv: string;
  passwordEnv: string;
  defaultEmail: string;
  defaultPassword: string;
  storageStatePath: `.auth/${string}.json`;
};
```

Create auth state in the serial Playwright `setup` project, not a browser-launching `globalSetup`
or per-test login loop:

```typescript
await page.context().storageState({ path: ".auth/admin.json" });
const context = await browser.newContext({ storageState: ".auth/admin.json" });
```

**Rules:**
- Use a serial `setup` project to create auth state before dependent projects run
- Use `.auth/` directory (gitignored) for state files
- One file per persona: `.auth/admin.json`, `.auth/agent.json`, etc.
- Regenerate on CI every run -- never cache auth state across builds or targets
- Missing or invalid persona state fails closed (or explicitly skips with the requested persona named)
- Never silently substitute a more privileged fallback persona
- Storage state includes cookies and localStorage, not sessionStorage

## Credential Sources

| Source | When | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| Environment variable | CI, shared test accounts | `process.env.ADMIN_EMAIL` |
| Deterministic fallback | Local dev with seeded DB | `"admin@platform.test"` |
| `.env` file | Local dev through the package-owned dotenvx boundary | `ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@test` |

**Best practice:** Env var with deterministic fallback matching the seeded persona catalog. CI sets
the env var; local dev uses the fallback.

```typescript
const ADMIN: AuthCredentials = {
  email: process.env.ADMIN_EMAIL || "admin@platform.test",
  password: process.env.ADMIN_PASSWORD || "TestPassword123!",
};
```

Never commit real credentials. Test accounts should be seeded by the dev database
setup script and use obvious test passwords.

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Why It Fails | Do Instead |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Login in every test body | Every test pays the full login round-trip even though the app under test never changes | Use fixtures or setup-generated storage state |
| Hardcoded selectors without data-testid | Selectors built from CSS classes or DOM structure break on harmless UI refactors | Add `data-testid` attributes to login form |
| `page.waitForTimeout(3000)` after login | A fixed timeout flakes under CI variance and cold caches | `page.waitForURL()` on post-login redirect |
| Sharing browser context across roles | Reusing one context across roles leaks the first role's session into the second role's requests | One context per role (fixture teardown closes it) |
| Silent privileged fallback | Loading admin/platform-owner state when the requested staff/attendee persona is missing hides real auth defects | Fail closed or explicitly skip with remediation |
| Storing `.auth/*.json` in git or reusing prior-build state | Live session files leak credentials and go stale across builds/targets | Gitignore `.auth/`, regenerate per CI run/target |

## External Effects in Auth Journeys

Auth E2E flows that send verification, invitation, magic-link, or password-reset email MUST keep
the real browser route, auth service, token persistence, and authorization behavior. Substitute
only the terminal delivery through the application's injected `EmailDelivery` interface and its
deterministic run-scoped E2E adapter. Both POM and fixture styles import the same typed persona
catalog and `.auth/<persona>.json` paths; provider substitution never changes the auth ownership
model.

- Resolve the exact safe delivery receipt from the run-owned adapter store before asserting success.
- Read test tokens/links from the deterministic mailbox contract, never from a shared Resend inbox.
- Fail before production provider contact when E2E adapter selection or run identity is invalid.
- Do not use `page.route` to fulfill the application's auth endpoint; that bypasses the server flow.
- Keep a separate production-adapter integration lane for Resend authentication and response mapping.
- Never claim deterministic mailbox success proves real email delivery.

See `t3-testing-patterns` Rule 13 for the provider-boundary contract. POM versus fixture selection
still depends only on whether the login UI itself is under test; provider substitution does not
change the auth integration style.
